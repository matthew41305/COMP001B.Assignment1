    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <p>What do you hope to learn in your CSS course?</p>

    <p>After taking the previous course, I'm excited to further my knowledge in using both HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>The thing that I want to learn the most is what creative things I can do with CSS to style the sites we will be creating,
        and how I can use what we learn in this class and apply it to my personal websites.</p>
        <p>One thing I really want to learn more about is how to make a website look modern just by using code, and what other extension may help us acheive that look.</p>
